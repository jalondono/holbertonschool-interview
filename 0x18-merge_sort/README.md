A function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Merge Sort algorithm:

Prototype: void merge_sort(int *array, size_t size);
top-down merge sort algorithm
the size of the left array should always be <= the size of the right array. i.e. {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} -> {1, 2}, {3, 4, 5}
Sort the left array before the right array
allowed to use printf
allowed to use malloc and free only once (only one call)
In the file 0-O, Big O notations of the time complexity of the Merge Sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

in the best case
in the average case
in the worst case
